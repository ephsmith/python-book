## Why learn Python?
You may already have an answer to this question. In this session we'll
assume you still have doubts and attempt to answer the question "Why
should I learn Python?".

There are myriad reasons to learn Python that are different depending
on your field of interest. There are various industry domains where
Python shines (links available at the bottom of this page):

- web development
- information technology
- data science

Within these industry sectors there are other options however. In data
science for example [R](https://www.r-project.org) and SQL are both
widely used languages. For web development, there are a host of other
languages that can be used as web-backends: PHP, Node, and Java to
name a few. *Why learn Python?*

Any attempt to answer this absolutely is a foolish endeavour. There
are, however, several strenghts of the Python language that make it a
standout choice.

- Python is freely to download and use.
- Python runs on all major architectures and operating sytems.
- Python is a general purpose programming language.
- Python has a *very* clean and readable syntax.
- Python is popular!

Simply listing these attributes of Python in a list may not be
enough. The next few sections expand upon each.

## Python is freely available
Python is open source and licensed in a manner that makes it agreeable
with many coporate applications based on the language. Python can be
used to create professional products without license fees or license
requirements.

You can read more about Python licenses on the [History and
License](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html) page of the official
Python site.

## Python runs on all major architecutres
[Official Python installation packages](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/) are available for X86, ARM, and
Apple M-series architecures for both Windows and macOS. Linux and UNIX packages
are made available by package maintainers via the source releases made
available on the official Python site.

## Python is general-purpose.
If Python is specialized for anything, it is being a useful language
in just about every computing domain. Python finds uses in everything
from simple system adminstration tasks to full-fledged GUI
applications. Given its popularity, there are many official and 3-rd
party Python libraries that extend the language's use cases across a full spectrum of computing / development tasks.
