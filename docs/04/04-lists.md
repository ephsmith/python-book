# Python Lists
The `list` type was first introduced in [Text_Type](../02/02-basic-types.md#list-types)
. Lists are a mutable sequence type in Python.  This means that lists have and order 
and can be modified in place (without having to create a copy).  Lists are arguable 
the most widely used collection type in Python. 

# Review of the Basics
- lists contain sequences of objects (any Python type)
- list elements can be of mixed types
- index elements of a list just like any other sequence type
