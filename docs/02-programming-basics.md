# Editing and Running Python Modules
A minimal Python development workflow includes a few activities:

- creating (editing) a Python module
- running the Python module
- inspecting, validating output.

To accomplish these steps, we need a few applications:

- an editor to edit files
- a Python interpreter to "run" Python modules (files)
- a terminal window to invoke the interpreter and view output.

We could simply install Python and use the editor and terminal supplied by our 
operating system.  An IDE is a more appropriate application and
