# About
This web text was started in the Fall of 2022 as a support text for
Software Programming, a course that I instruct a Christian Brother's
University in Memphis, TN.

There are a number of fantastic books on the subject of Python
programming. However none of the books that I met my standards to
alignment with the introductory requirements of the course while still providing
enough depth in coverage of the language. My effort here is an
attempt to fill the gap that I have found in the literature.

The medium I have chosen is a hosted site-based text. This provides a
number of benefits for both author and reader.

- continuous updates
- interactive content
- modern web reading experience that is a readable on mobile as it is
  on desktop

I hope that this book serves as a faithful introduction to the Python
language. Wherever necessary or beneficial to the reader, I will lean
on references to sources in the vast body of work where other authors
have shared their experise.

# Python Version
Python version 3.10 is the target version for this text, however the 
majority of examples and language features discussed in the text are
compatible with Python versions 3.6 or higher. 

Note that as of October 2022, Python 3.10 is the current stable release
of the language, it is *not* the current defacto standard in use. That is
to say that many widely used products have not adopted 3.10. For example,
if you sign up for a free Google Colab account and begin authoring Python
notebooks there, the Python version will likely be 3.8. 

When in doubt about language features, one can always reference the
[official documentation](https://docs.python.org) and select the correct
version from the dropdown.
