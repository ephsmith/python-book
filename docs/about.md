# About
This web text was started in the Fall of 2022 as a support text for
Software Programming, a course that I instruct a Christian Brother's
University in Memphis, TN.

The medium I have chosen is a GitHub hosted [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) site using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). This provides a number of benefits for both author and reader.

- continuous updates 
- interactive content
- modern web reading experience that is a readable on mobile as it is
  on desktop

I hope that this book serves as a faithful introduction to the Python
language. Wherever necessary or beneficial to the reader, I will lean
on references to sources in the vast body of work where other authors
have shared their experise.

# Python Version
Python versions 3.10 and above are the target of this doc, however the 
majority of examples and language features discussed in the text are
compatible with Python versions 3.6 or higher. 

Note that as of August 2023, Python 3.12 is the current stable release
of the language, it is *not* the current defacto standard in use. That is
to say that many widely used products have not adopted 3.12. 

When in doubt about language features, one can always reference the
[official documentation](https://docs.python.org) and select the correct
version from the dropdown.
