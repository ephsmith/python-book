# About
This web text was started in the Fall of 2022 as a support text for
Software Programming, a course that I instruct a Christian Brother's
University in Memphis, TN.

There are a number of fantastic books on the subject of Python
programming. However none of the books that I met my standards to
alignment with the introductory requirements of the course while still providing
enough depth in coverage of the language. My effort here is an
attempt to fill the gap that I have found in the literature.

The medium I have chosen is a hosted site-based text. This provides a
number of benefits for both author and reader.

- continuous updates
- interactive content
- modern web reading experience that is a readable on mobile as it is
  on desktop

I hope that this book serves as a faithful introduction to the Python
language. Wherever necessary or beneficial to the reader, I will lean
on references to sources in the vast body of work where other authors
have shared their experise.
