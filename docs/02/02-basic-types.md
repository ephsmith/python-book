## Introduction
In software programming data types are an important concept. Python programs can 
operate on a variety of types of data.  Different types are handled differently in a 
Python program so it is important to understand the basic types that Python provides.

Python data types fall into two categories: 
- simple or atomic data types: can not be decomposed into a collection of another type
- non-atomic data types: are composed of other types

## Built-in Atomic Types
Python has the following bult-in atomic types:

- Text type: `str`
- Numeric types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- Boolean type: `bool`
- None Type: `NoneType`

## Built-in Non-Atomic Types

- Sequences: `list`, `tuple`
- Mappings: `dict`
- Sets: `set`, `frozenset`
- Binary Types: `bytes`, `bytearray`
