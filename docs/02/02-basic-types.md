## Introduction
In software programming data types are an important concept. Python programs can 
operate on a variety of types of data.  Different types are handled differently in a 
Python program so it is important to understand the basic types that Python provides.

Python data types fall into two categories: 
- atomic data types: can not be decomposed into a collection of another type
- non-atomic data types: are composed of other types
