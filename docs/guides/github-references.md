## Introduction

This reference is for students taking the course associated with this text. 
Assignments in the course will be submitted via GitHub Classroom.  This document links 
relevant supporting references from the 
[Git and GitHub Learning Resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) page.

## Create a GitHub Account
Students will need a GitHub account in order to complete assignments in the course. 
Assignment instructions, starter code, and supporting data are all available via a  
GitHub repository which is available to students once they accept the assignment 
invitation. Moreover, industry standard CI tools are used to grade student work. 

In order to access assignments, a GitHub account is needed. Note that there is *no 
requirement* that you use your university email address when signing up. You may even 
use an existing GitHub account. 

If you do not already have a GitHub account, sign up for one at 
[GitHub](https://www.github.com).

## Installing GitHub Desktop
Git is a version control system that tracks changes to text based files (like Python 
code) which are stored in a git repository (repo).  A repository is a directory that a 
git application watches for changes. Git provides:

- snapshots of changes / change sets
- the ability to merge several sets of changes
- the ability to roll back changes
- branching changes where a set of changes to a codebase can be developed separately 
  from the primary codebase. 
- both local and remote repository change syncing via commits (adding changes to 
  history), pushing (sending local changes to remote), and pulling (retrieving changes 
  from the remote). 

GitHub provides access to all of this functionality via the 
[GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com)

## Accepting and Assignment
In order to begin working on an assignment, students must accept an assignment 
invitation link. The steps involved in accepting a link are as follows:

1. Click the invitation link. Your browser will open to a GitHub classroom assignment 
   page.
    <figure markdown>
    ![GitHub Assignment Pick User](../img/r-github-assignment-accept-user.png){width="300"}
    <figcaption>Select Yourself from the List</figcaption>
    </figure>
2. Next, select your name from the student identifier list to link your GitHub account 
   to the assignment.  This list should contain an entry that you can use to uniquely 
   identify yourself--Name, Username, and Email are present. *Note: If your name is 
   not present, select "skip to the next step" and inform your instructor that you 
   need to be added to the list.
3. The next screen that greets you is the *assignment acceptance screen*. Click 
   "Accept this Assignment".
    <figure markdown>
    ![Accept this Assignment](../img/r-github-accept-this-assignment.png){width="300"}
    <figcaption>Accept the Assignment</figcaption>
    </figure>
4. When you accept the assignment, a copy of the assignment repository is copied to 
   your account so that you can work with it. The screen that appears notes that you 
   need to refresh the page to get the link.  When you refresh the page, you'll be 
   greeted with a link.

    <figcaption>Repository Ready... click the link.</figcaption>
